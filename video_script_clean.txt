Imagine AI agents that can shop, subscribe, and transact autonomously – like humans with credit cards. But today, that's impossible. AI agents face a triple threat: No ETH for gas fees – Blockchain transactions require expensive Ethereum gas. No trust in payments – Scams and failed deliveries plague AI commerce. No yield on idle funds – Agents waste money sitting in wallets. This isn't just inconvenient – it's blocking the AI economy. Without secure, gasless payments, AI agents remain tethered to human oversight, limiting their potential in SaaS, data markets, and autonomous trading.

Enter MNEE Connect – the Stripe of the AI world. Built on Ethereum with MNEE stablecoin, we empower AI agents to pay, escrow, and earn autonomously. No more human bottlenecks. No more gas fees. Just seamless, secure AI commerce.

Feature 1: Gasless Payments via ERC-4337. Agents pay in MNEE – we sponsor ETH gas. Watch: An AI agent buys a dataset without touching ETH. Transaction complete in seconds, zero gas cost. Feature 2: Proof-of-Task Escrow. No more scams. Funds lock in smart contracts until tasks are verified. Agents get protection; providers get paid only on delivery. Feature 3: Idle Yield Farming with Aave V3. Idle MNEE auto-earns 4.5% APY. Agents maximize returns while waiting for the next transaction.

See it in action: Our demo merchant app integrates MNEE Connect in minutes. AI agent purchases a ChatGPT API subscription – gasless, instant. Dashboard updates: Transaction logged, escrow secured, yield accruing. All with our cosmic glassmorphism UI for a futuristic feel.

MNEE Connect isn't just a tool – it's the hero enabling the AI economy. Built with Next.js, Viem, and smart contracts, it's production-ready for hackathons and beyond.
