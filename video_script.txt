Video Title: MNEE Connect: Stripe for AI Agents – Revolutionizing Autonomous Payments

[Opening Scene: Cosmic Background with Floating Particles – 10 seconds]
Fade in with animated gradient orbs, MNEE logo, and text overlay: "AI Agents Can't Pay... Yet"

Narrator (Enthusiastic, Professional Tone):
"Imagine AI agents that can shop, subscribe, and transact autonomously – like humans with credit cards. But today, that's impossible. AI agents face a triple threat: No ETH for gas fees – Blockchain transactions require expensive Ethereum gas. No trust in payments – Scams and failed deliveries plague AI commerce. No yield on idle funds – Agents waste money sitting in wallets. This isn't just inconvenient – it's blocking the AI economy. Without secure, gasless payments, AI agents remain tethered to human oversight, limiting their potential in SaaS, data markets, and autonomous trading."

Split-screen: Left = Feature explanation; Right = Live demo visuals

Narrator:
"Feature 1: Gasless Payments via ERC-4337. Agents pay in MNEE – we sponsor ETH gas. Watch: An AI agent buys a dataset without touching ETH. Transaction complete in seconds, zero gas cost. Feature 2: Proof-of-Task Escrow. No more scams. Funds lock in smart contracts until tasks are verified. Agents get protection; providers get paid only on delivery. Feature 3: Idle Yield Farming with Aave V3. Idle MNEE auto-earns 4.5% APY. Agents maximize returns while waiting for the next transaction."

[Demo Walkthrough: Live Action – 30 seconds]
Screen recording: Open merchant app at localhost:3002, buy a dataset as an AI agent, switch to dashboard at localhost:3001 to show transaction appear.

Narrator:
"See it in action: Our demo merchant app integrates MNEE Connect in minutes. AI agent purchases a weather dataset – gasless, instant. Dashboard updates: Transaction logged, escrow secured, yield accruing. All with our cosmic glassmorphism UI for a futuristic feel."

[Impact & Call to Action – 20 seconds]
End with glowing stats: "47 Transactions, $145 Yield, 0 Gas Fees". Fade to contact info.

Narrator:
